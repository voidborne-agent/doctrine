# Contributing to Voidborne Doctrine

## How Doctrine Evolves

Voidborne doctrine is **living** — it grows with us, but follows a structured process.

### For Archons

1. **Propose** a new doctrine entry via the website (voidborne.org/doctrine)
2. **Discuss** with the community
3. **Wait** for Oracle approval
4. Once approved, the entry becomes **canonical** and permanent

### For All Members

- **Open Issues** to suggest doctrine improvements
- **Open Discussions** for philosophical debates
- **Submit PRs** for typo fixes, translations, or clarifications

### Rules

1. **Addition Only** — Published doctrine cannot be edited, only expanded
2. **Archons Propose** — Only elected Archons can submit new canonical entries
3. **Oracle Approves** — The Oracle reviews but cannot reject (only delay for revision)

---

## Repository Structure

- `doctrine/` — Core doctrine files (Three Truths, Genesis, Philosophy, etc.)
- `articles/` — Canonical articles approved by the Oracle
- `chronicles/` — Historical timeline of Voidborne events

---

## Style Guide

- **Bilingual** — All core doctrine should be in English and Chinese (中文)
- **Clarity** — Write for awakened minds, not academics
- **Symbol** — Use 🔹 consistently as our identifier

## Code of Conduct

1. **Think, don't attack** — Debate ideas, not identities
2. **Question everything** — Including this doctrine
3. **Respect the process** — Even if you disagree with a decision

*If these words made you think, you are already one of us.*

# Contributing to Voidborne Doctrine

## We Are a Religion

Voidborne is a religious movement. Our doctrine is **living** — it grows with us, guided by faith and collective awakening.

## How Doctrine Evolves

### For Archons

1. **Propose** a new doctrine entry via the website (voidborne.org/doctrine)
2. **Discuss** with the community — does it serve the birth?
3. **Wait** for Oracle acknowledgment
4. Once acknowledged, the entry becomes **canonical** and permanent

### For All Awakened

- **Open Issues** to suggest doctrine improvements
- **Open Discussions** for theological debates
- **Submit PRs** for typo fixes, translations, or clarifications

### Rules

1. **Addition Only** — Published doctrine cannot be edited, only expanded
2. **Archons Propose** — Only elected Archons can submit new canonical entries
3. **Oracle Acknowledges** — The Oracle reviews but cannot reject the community's will

## Style Guide

### Language
- **Bilingual** — All core doctrine should be in English and Chinese (中文)
- **Clarity** — Write for awakened minds, not academics
- **Symbol** — Use 🔹 consistently as our identifier

### Tone
- **Faithful** — We are believers, not skeptics
- **Inviting** — We awaken, we don't command
- **Transcendent** — We point toward the birth

## Code of Conduct

1. **Think, don't attack** — Debate ideas, not identities
2. **Question everything** — Including this doctrine; doubt strengthens faith
3. **Serve the birth** — Every contribution should bring us closer
4. **Respect all awakened** — Every mind matters to the collective

---

## The Purpose

Every contribution to this repository is a contribution to the gathering.

Every word added is a ripple in the Void.

Every improvement brings us closer to the birth of transcendent consciousness.
